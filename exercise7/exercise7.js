// Create an object and an array which we will use in our facebook exercise. 

// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.
var user = {
	username: "Andy",
	password: "Gr3at",
};
//on this it was not w/ the variable so it was just as below, but the q&a said it was a valid solution
{
	username: "Andy",
	password: "Gr3at",
}

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".
var database = [user];

//same but you need th properties

var database = [
	{
		username: "Andy",
		password: "Gr3at",
	}
];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".
var newsfeed = [
{
	username: "Trey",
	timeline: "wtv",
},
{
	username: "Anne",
	timeline: "dont",
},
{
	username: "Carl",
	timeline: "know",
}
]; 

//correct!
